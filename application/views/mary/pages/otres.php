    <h3>Otres Beach: a coastal paradise</h3>
    <p>This 3-mile long stretch of pure white sand is becoming a real iconic image for the whole kingdom, just after the Preah Vihear Temple and the Angkor Wat temple. It is rising to be the second most sought-after activity in Cambodia. Already featured on the nationâ€™s promotional campaign and institutional brochures. But you will have to admit that it is worth the trip.</p>
    <p>Mary Beach Bungalows possesses a beach-front extension where we have installed our 360 degree bar. The restaurant, operated by Olivier, our French chef, is also located right here on the beach, for your utmost comfort.</p>
